# Mathler Solver

Simple brute-force script I created to solve Mathler puzzles.
Requires Python 3 to be installed on your system.

## Features
- Supports easy, medium, and hard difficulty
- Checks for valid Mathler expressions (e.g. no leading 0's)
- Allows inputting a previous guess to narrow the answers

## TODO
[ ] Implement this as a CSP problem and use something like GAC to speed the process up ~100,000x

Usage: `python3 solver.py`
